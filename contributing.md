## Contributing to the OAuth 2.0 Server

If you'd like to contribute to this package we'd like you to keep a few things in mind:

1. If you're submitting a new feature then please take the time to propose the idea first. Please keep the [OAuth 2.0 specification](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) in mind as this package avoids deviating from the specification.
2. Any new features should initially be branched off of the `develop` branch and pull requests should target the `develop` branch.
3. Bug fix pull requests do not require a proposal and should target the `master` branch.
4. Always run `phpunit` after making any changes to ensure all tests pass. If adding a new feature ensure you write applicable tests.

Messy pull requests will generally not be merged. Please try to keep your code neat and follow the existing coding style.

Cheers and thanks for contributing!
